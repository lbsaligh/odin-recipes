        <li>500g spaghetti sauce (marinara)</li>
        <li>500g cottage cheese</li>
        <li>300g mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (tbsp) dried parsley</li>
        <li>Himalayan salt</li>
        <li>5 lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>Cup of water</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step-by-step guide:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the lasagna sauce</strong> using the ground beef, vegetables, marinara sauce, tomato puree, garlic and herbs and let simmer for 20 mins until the liquid reduces and thickens.</li>

        <li><strong>let the sauce simmer whilst grating the cheese and boil the lasagne sheets.</strong> Whilst the lasagna sheets are boiling, slice and grate the required amount of mozzarella, ricotta cheese and parmesan.</li>

        <li><strong>Time to assemble!</strong> In a baking tray, add a layer of meat sauce, a lasagna sheet, more sauce and then the cheesy goodness! Keep repeating this process for all lasagna sheets and then on the final layer, add the meat sauce and finish with the rest of the cheese.</li>

        <li><strong>Let's bake!</strong> Finally, add the tray of lasagna goodness to a pre-heated oven at fan 180 degrees celsius and let that bake for 20 mins or until the cheese has melted and browned a little bit.</li>
