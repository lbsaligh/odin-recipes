    <h2>Step-by-step guide:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><u>Make the topping:</strong></u> In a small bowl, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add panko, Parmesan, salt, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. Set aside.</li>

        <li><strong><u>Boil the pasta:</strong></u> Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium high heat. Add the macaroni and salt. Cook until the pasta is firm-tender, or al dente.</li>

        <li><strong><u>Make the sauce:</strong></u> In a large, high sided skillet set over medium heat, add the cream cheese, 1 cup of milk, and all of the spices. Break apart and smash the cream cheese with a spatula as it begins to soften and melt.</li>

        <li><strong><u>Add pasta to the sauce:</strong></u> Once the sauce is thick like heavy whipping cream and homogeneous, add the pasta. Stir to coat. </li>

        <li><strong><u>Top with the panko and bake:</strong></u> Sprinkle the panko mixture over the top of the mac and cheese. Place in oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown and the cheese sauce is bubbling around the edges.</li>
    </ol>
